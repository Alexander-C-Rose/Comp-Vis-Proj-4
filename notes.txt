Gabor Filter the image with 4x4 to start (most optimal in projec 3).
    Don't use statistics; just need the 16 dimensional column feature vector.
    Must smooth and normalize to a new vector.
    Try adding x and y information to the feature vector to improve accuracy.

Smoothing should be a 3x3 with the center pixel being the pixel smoothed.
    Should I use the smoothed pixels or original pixel value when smoothing the next pixel? 
    Might try both for report purposes.

Now can do multi-dimensional EM algorithm to find mu, alpha, and sigma.

Find missing data in form of posterior probablility

Then classify each pixel

Process:
    Use MATLAB k-means function to find most optimal result (minimum divergence)
    Initialize EM with this result.

    Try good initialization with k-mean as well as bad initialization to see effect.

Plot data log-likelihood vs iteration number
Plot segmentation accuracy vs iteration number

Create a video to show progrerssion of the segmentation map during EM iteration.
